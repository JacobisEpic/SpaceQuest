### 🌌 Project Objective

SpaceQuest, the **first-place project** in the BostonHacks 2024 CometCare track, was created to address the challenges astronauts face during long periods of separation from loved ones on Earth. With SpaceQuest, astronauts can enjoy an interactive and fun solution to stay connected with family and friends. The app provides a collection of mini-games that support bonding and help strengthen cognitive function. Through friendly competition and shared memories, SpaceQuest brings people closer, no matter the distance. 🌍✨

### 🎮 Solution Features

SpaceQuest is built on the idea of using games to bring people together across space. 🌠 The app includes three asynchronous mini-games: **iSpy**, **Trivia**, and **Jigsaw Puzzle**! These games allow for back-and-forth interaction between users, encouraging meaningful connections. Here’s a breakdown of the features:

- **iSpy** 🕵️‍♂️ and **Jigsaw Puzzle** 🧩 are picture-based games, while **Trivia** 🧠 offers a database of challenging and fun questions.
  
- For picture-based games, users can capture real-time images of themselves or their surroundings, then choose the game they'd like the photo to go to. The photo is saved to a database, allowing a user on the other end to load it and play **iSpy** or solve the **Jigsaw Puzzle**.
  
  - **iSpy** 🕵️‍♀️ lets users guess objects in the shared photo, creating a unique interactive experience with personal images.
  
  - **Jigsaw Puzzle** 🖼️ takes a meaningful image (like a family photo) and converts it into a 4x4 puzzle. The astronaut can solve the puzzle to reveal a heartwarming image of their loved ones.

- **Trivia** 🧩 offers a back-and-forth question-answer game from a verified database, adding a competitive edge with challenging questions.

All game points are tracked on a **leaderboard** 📊, where correct Trivia answers, successful iSpy guesses, and completed Jigsaw Puzzles earn one point each. This system encourages friendly competition, keeping everything fresh, fun, and supportive of meaningful connections. ❤️
