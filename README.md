### Project Objective

With many astronauts often having to be away from loved ones for extended periods of time, astronauts often suffer from lack of social interaction with their counterparts down on Earth. Whether it be family or friends, SpaceQuest is an interactive and fun solution that provides a collection of mini games that can be played between those up in space and those down on the ground! SpaceQuest allows for friendly competition while integrating the creation of sentimental memories that'll not only help support bonds, but also help assist in strengthening cognitive function.

### Solution Features

SpaceQuest was developed with the idea to involve games as a form of entertainment that could bring people together. The app features three mini games: iSpy, Trivia, and Jigsaw Puzzle! All games are asynchronous and allow for back-and-forth game interactions between users. iSpy and Jigsaw Puzzle are picture-based while Trivia can be played natively through answering from the database of verified questions . For the picture-based games, users must first enter the image capture option where they can capture a real-time image of themselves or their surroundings. The user then chooses which game they'd like the photo to go to. The photo is sent to a database and a user on the other end will have that photo loaded from the database to then play iSpy or Jigsaw Puzzle. For iSpy, a photo is loaded so the user on the other end can guess answers for objects in the photo. For Jigsaw Puzzle, the image is loaded and converted to a screen where users can solve the a 4x4 matrix puzzle and attempt to see if they got it right! The Jigsaw Puzzle could be a picture of an astronaut's family and the astronaut can then solve the puzzle to see a beautiful photo of their family. Everything is then tracked to a leaderboard where answering each trivia question correctly, guessing correctly in iSpy, or solving the jigsaw puzzle will each garner one point. Family and friends are able to keep track and have fun competition while keeping everything fresh, loving, and entertaining!
